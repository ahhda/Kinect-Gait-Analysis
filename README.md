# Kinect-Gait-Analysis
Track and identify skeleton based on their walking style
Human recognition in surveillance system has become one of
the challenging tasks for security aspects. Currently applied 
systems based on face, fingerprint, iris etc. have certain 
limitations like their intrusiveness, obtrusiveness, reliability, bio-
matric data privacy. GAIT features like walking style, variation of 
angles in different body joints are some of the unique features 
which in integrated manner can be used for recognizing a 
person. 

The project introduces an innovative way for human recognition 
using GAIT and other body features which is an uninstructive, 
robust, reliable way of human recognition which provides and 
alternative way to the currently established system based on 
face, fingerprint and iris.
